# 100 Days of Swift - Project Collection

This repository contains all the projects I built while completing the **100 Days of Swift** course by [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/). The course covers various Swift programming concepts and UIKit for building iOS applications. Each project helped me strengthen my understanding of Swift and iOS development, from basic syntax to advanced features.

## Course Overview

The **100 Days of Swift** course is structured to teach iOS development using Swift over 100 days. Each day includes lessons and practical projects to apply the concepts. Below is a list of the projects included in this repository, covering a wide range of iOS development topics.

## Projects

- **Art Gallery**: A simple app to display images in a gallery format.
- **Authentication App**: User biometric login.
- **Base Project**: The foundational project template used throughout the course.
- **Filter App**: An image filter app where users can apply various filters to photos.
- **Fruit Ninja**: A simple game inspired by the popular Fruit Ninja game, built using UIKit.
- **Hangman Game**: A word-guessing game where users try to guess a hidden word letter by letter.
- **Local Notification**: Demonstrates how to schedule and display local notifications in an iOS app.
- **Location Book**: Allows users to save and track locations using GPS.

- **Petitions Project GCD**: An extension of the Petitions project using Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) for handling concurrency.
- **Photo Collection**: A photo gallery app where users can view and manage their photos.
- **Photo Collection Codable**: An enhanced version of the Photo Collection app using the `Codable` protocol for data persistence.
- **Photo Collection UserDefaults**: Another variant of the Photo Collection app, but with persistence through `UserDefaults`.
- **Shopping List**: A basic shopping list app where users can add, edit, and remove items.
- **Word Project**: A word game that challenges users to create as many words as possible from a set of letters.
